One to One Bidirectional mapping

classes -> User and Address
Relation -> One user can have only one address and one address belongs to one user.
(Just assuming a scenario for this tutorial)

main class -> User and address
dependent class -> User and address

- On the owning side of the relationship
(the entity that has the foreign key column),
annotate the reference field with @OneToOne and @JoinColumn to specify the name of
the foreign key column and the referenced column in the other table.
We can also use cascade and fetch attributes to define the cascade and
fetch strategies for the relationship.


- On the non-owning side of the relationship
(the entity that does not have the foreign key column),
annotate the reference field with @OneToOne and mappedBy to indicate the name of the
field on the owning side that maps to this entity.
