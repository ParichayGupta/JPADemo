One to One Unidirectional mapping

classes -> Person and Passport
Relation -> One person can have only one passport.

main class -> Person
dependent class -> passport

since Passport is associated with Person we are mapping @oneToOne on Passport attribute
inside Person class.

Table in database

Person
- id
- name
- passport_id

Passport
- id
- passport_number;

When using Generation Type -> AUTO
in database a new table get created for each entity whichever has this generation type.

for example -> for person table a new table gets created
as person_seq for maintaining the sequence for the Id.
